      <p class="descriptor">The Pivot to Civic initiative aims to build a talent pipeline of budding designers, developers, and product people into the social impact technology space. We are a group of recent grads who set out to cultivate a community of entry-level techies and provide them the opportunity to make an impact. <span style="color: #EA3433;">We seek to educate, connect, and equip the next generation of mission-driven technologists with the tools they need to make a difference.</span>
        <br><br>
        We'll send you jobs with organizations that are, in some way, working to make the world better. We'll send you openings in product, design, and engineering from advocacy organizations, government, social enterprise, and more.

        <p class="descriptor"> We're still here! Pivot to Civic started during Coding it Forward's 2018 <a href="https://www.codingitforward.com/fellowship/"><span style="color: #EA3433;">Civic Digital Fellowship</span></a>, so it's fitting that it merged with the organization that helped start it. With the Coding it Forward team behind us, we're able to be even more creative and ambitious with our content.</p>
